What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
Cloud Engineering is about building and managing the digital infrastructure—the servers, databases, and networks—that allow applications to run globally without the need for physical hardware.
DevOps is the bridge between writing code and running it. It’s a culture and a set of practices (like CI/CD and Automation) designed to shorten the development lifecycle while maintaining high software quality. 
Essentially, Cloud provides the 'where,' and DevOps provides the 'how.
